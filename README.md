# sealedmessages

Sealed Messages is a time based message platform. When a message is created, a
date to reveal the contents of the message is picked. It is impossible to see
what the message contains before its reveal date. Once a message has been
created, it can never be changed. This tool was inspired by the concept of
adjournment in chess.
